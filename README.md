# CustomRoundedCorners

A Swift Playground to demonstrate creating a view in iOS with different rounded corners

This Playground displays several different methods of adding rounded corners to a UIView for an iOS app.  The first two examples display methods to round selected corners which have the same radius.  The third example uses a `UIBezierPath` to draw a custom mask to provide for different radii for different corners.

### Example 1
![First example of a photo with rounded corners on the top.](Example1.png)

### Example 2
![Second example of a photo with rounded corners on the right.](Example2.png)

### Example 3
![Third example of a photo with rounded corners of different radii on the top.](Example3.png)
